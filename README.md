# simplemedia
A web application to upload, view, manage, and share media across devices.  


## What is it?
A web application to upload, view, manage, and share media across devices.
  
## What does it do?
This provides functionality to:
*	Upload and archive media
*	Identify duplicate files, based on capture time, source, and file size.
*	Basic editing functionality (crop, resize)
*	Add notes and labels to individual or groups of files.
*	Scroll though thousands of images without overwhelming the browser.
*	Search across a variety of criteria using Angular Material components such as auto complete and an OData backend service.


## How was it made?
The front end uses Angular.js and Angular Material for responsiveness across devices. Restful services were created using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, and OData middleware. Data is stored in MongoDB. This uses Gulp tools for production build and managing development instances.
This used an angular material template called Fuse to house this application. I removed most of the template from what is pushed to the GIT repository so that it only shows the parts that I worked on. If you are interested, I can send the entire project.
